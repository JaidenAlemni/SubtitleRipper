# Subtitle Downloader and Converter

This is a very primative script I created for downloading and converting subtitle files from a certain website and converting them to various formats. 

The URLs/website titles have been redacted for privacy reasons, so this can't actually be used outside of the CSV / SRT conversion functions. But those were also specific to the format from that particular website. 

At this point, it just serves as an example of using Ruby to fetch a request from JSON, (or XML with Nokogiri), and do something with it.
